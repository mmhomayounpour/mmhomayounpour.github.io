I am a professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran. I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (1987), an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Khajenasireddin Toosi University (1990), a DEA in Phonetics from Nouvelle Sorbonne University, Paris (France), and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Paris 11 (Orsay) University, Paris, France (1995).

My research interests are broad, spanning areas such as speech and signal processing, natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, multimedia processing, and hardware design. Over the years, I've been involved in numerous research and academic projects that aim to push the boundaries of these fields.

Currently, I am leading several research initiatives and collaborations at Amirkabir University of Technology, contributing to advancements in AI and signal processing.

excerpt: 'Nowadays the most commonly used method in various tasks of machine learning and artificial intelligence are neural networks. In spite of their different uses, neural networks and Deep neural networks (DNNs) have some vulnerabilities. A little distortion or adversarial perturbation in the input data for both additive and non-additive cases can be led to change the output of the trained model, and this could be a kind of DNN vulnerability. Despite the imperceptibility of the mentioned disturbance for human beings, DNN is vulnerable to these changes.Creating and applying any malicious perturbation named “attack”, penetrates DNNs and makes them incapable of doing the duty assigned to them. In this paper different attack approaches were categorized based on the signal applied in the attack procedure. Some approaches use the gradient signal for detecting the vulnerability of DNN and try to create a powerful attack. The other ones create a perturbation in a blind situation and change a portion of the input to create a potential malicious perturbation. Adversarial attacks include both black-box and White-box situations. White-box situation focuses on training loss function and the architecture of the model but black box situation focuses on the approximation of the main model and dealing with the restriction of the input-output model request.'
